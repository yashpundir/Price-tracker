       PRICE TRACKER
=============================

What this application does is explained on my github repo :-
https://github.com/Noobie20/Price-tracker

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is for explaining what the application needs in order to work properly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

< 1 > WEB - SCRAPING

The  script uses requests and BeautifulSoup for web-scraping.
Since Amazon uses different CSS IDs and classes for the products that are in a sale
or offer, the scipt can only scrape off data from regular products which are not in
any kind of sale/offer or anything like that. Since its fairly easy to implement the code
that would scrape products that are under sale/offer as well (just a different ID or
class in the HTML code), I might implement it soon.


< 2 > Google Spreadsheets

Google spreadsheets is used as an database for this application.
3 Google Spreadsheets will be needed, that would be on your G-Drive in order for this to work.
The format of the spreadsheets should be as follows:

 (I) Name : URLs
     2 Columns required:
     
     ITEM   |   URL    |
     ------------------------------
	    | 	       |	
     ------------------------------
     	    | 	       |
     ------------------------------
            |	       |


 (II) Name : Amazon
    1 Column required:
     
     DAY/PRODUCTS |	       |
     -------------------------------------
	          | 	       |	
     -------------------------------------
     	          | 	       |
     -------------------------------------
                  |	       |
    	
 (III) Name : Flipkart
       1 Column required:
       
       DAY/PRODUCTS |	       |
       -------------------------------------
	            | 	       |	
       -------------------------------------
       	            | 	       |
       -------------------------------------
                    |	       |

< 3 > APIs

This application uses 3 APIs :
   (i) Google Sheets API
  (ii) Google Drive API
 (iii) Twilio API

-In order for the application to work, the user must create an account on Google developers console
 After making an account, the user must enable Google Sheets API & Google Drive API.
 Once done, user must create credentials for the Google Sheets API, and download the json file that
 has the user's credentials in it. Watch this video in order to clearly understand this procedure :
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnPlKLEGR7E&t=603s
 After downloading the json file that has your credentials in it, rename it to 'credentials.json' and place
 it in the root of the directory.
 You also need to share your client_email (in credential.json) to the all 3 of the G-spreadsheets that you created 
 earlier, as shown in the video. This completes the G-Sheets API

-Now onto Twilio API for sending WhatsApp message purposes. Go to twilio's website and sign up for a free account
 Verify your phone whatsapp phone number through the process shown on the website. Store you credentials safely somewhere
 that you get for your Twilio API. You will need to send an 'ok' text to twilio API on your mobile everyday, for which a remonder is 
 already set in the code. 


< 3 > CLOUD DEPLOYMENT

 In order for the script to run everyday, the user needs to create a cloud service account. I used heroku. 
 Make a free heroku account, initiate a new app, install heroku CLI.
 Now make a folder where you can store all the necessary files for this project. This folder (root directoory) 
  must contain the following files:
 
 1. credentials.json (from the google developers console)
 2. Procfile (simple text file BUT WITH NO EXTENSION, JUST 'Procfile')
 3. requirements.txt (which can be created from CMD)
 4. runtime.txt
 5. source.py
 6. source_input.py

 Initiate a git repository here, add all files, commit them and push them to heroku.
 Then you
 Video tutorial for better understanding heroku deployment :
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qquCAgwvL8Q&t=828s
 You need to add your twilio API keys on heroku under the settings tab
 You also need to remember to push the files as is the folder structure shown above. No subfolder must be present.

 NOTE : The application will work and store data in the spreadsheets on for the 1st 23 days of every month since
 	heroku provides 550 free dyno hours per month to its free users. But you can expand this limit to 1000 free dyno hours
        per month by just verifying you credit card on ther heroku website, which will keep this application up and 
        running 24*7*365.The script actually is running 24*7 on the cloud and never stops, but the scraping part is done 
     	only once in 24 hours. 


 < 4 > USER - CONTROL

 The user can input the product (only from amazon or flipkart) by running the source_input.py script locally or from the cloud.
 The details are stored in the Google spreadsheet. And That's it.



----------SET UP COMPLETE----------------
The user can now sit back & relax and wait for the price of any particular product to drop, which if it does, the user shall revieve a message on 
WhatsApp regarding the same.
